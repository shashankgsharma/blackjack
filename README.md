# blackjack
black jack game, made with so much difficulties and errors, which could've been avoided by the precise use of functions and flags. Anyways, this code also includes functions, while loops and a flag, so that a player can repeatedly play the game until he/ she lilkes. Kindly mention any corrections/ improvements to this code, if possible. Thanks.
